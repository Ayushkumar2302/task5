Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information on the fate of passengers aboard the Titanic, summarizing data like age, fare, class, gender, and survival status.

2. Dataset Overview
Rows: 891

Columns: 12

Missing Values: Age (177), Cabin (687), Embarked (2)

3. Univariate Analysis
Most passengers were aged between 20-40 years.

Majority traveled in 3rd class.

Higher number of male passengers compared to females.

Most passengers embarked from port 'S' (Southampton).

4. Bivariate Analysis
Females had higher survival rates.

First-class passengers had higher survival rates than second and third class.

Higher fares linked to higher survival chances.

5. Multivariate Analysis
Heatmap showed a strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare.

Slight negative correlation between Age and Survival.

6. Key Insights
Females, 1st-class passengers, and those who paid higher fares had better survival chances.

Missing values in 'Cabin' should be handled carefully.

7. Conclusion
EDA helped uncover meaningful patterns.

Suggested that gender, fare, and class play significant roles in survival.
